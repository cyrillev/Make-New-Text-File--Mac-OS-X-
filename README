    - Installation
        This is an AppleScript .scpt file.  It may or may not transfer well over the 
        wire.  If that is the case, you can email me and request a plain text copy to 
        open and load into Script Editor, or whatever application you desire.
        
        I will try to keep a plain text copy as a clone of the source at all times.
