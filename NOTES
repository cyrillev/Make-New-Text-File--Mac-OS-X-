    10/16/2010 02:08:08 AM - There is a good deal of scrap code at the bottom
    of the Make New Text file.scpt file. This may come in handy if I need to
    alter this script to work in a way that roots with a file called
    "Untitled.txt" rather than the Untitled.mm.dd.yyyy.random.txt format I use
    now to avoid any collisions with duplate file names.

    If you do not have a Finder window open, the script will be aware of this
    and graceully abort.

    Curently, you can run the script from Script Eitor, which is not at all
    convenient, or, it can be run from a keyboard Macro Application like
    Keyboard Maestro. There is also fast scripts.

    All paths to shell commands are the full path, and should in theory work
    on all Mac OS X systems from around 10.2 forward. I dont thkn there is
    anything all that unusual i am using to make this happen, and AppleScript
    has been stable for a long time especially with the basic virable and
    condition being all I am using.

    This will only work on the Mac, though could be adapted to any *nix OS by
    probably going all bash, which I started trying to do, but got too messy
    with all the `do shell script` crap. Though do make sure you change the
    `open -a` as that is not supported anywhere but Max OS X I beieve.
